# Configuration

You can configure the parameters for your book in the `book.json` file.

Here is an example of what a `book.json` file might look like:

```
{
    "title": "Example book",
    "author": "Name",
}
```

#### Supported variables

- **title:** title of the book
- **author:** author of the book
- **dest:** path to the directory where you want your book to be rendered. If a relative path is given it will be relative to the parent directory of `src`
